title: How I set up my blog date: "2021-06-12T14:45:03.284Z"
description: 'An obligatory "Hello, World" meta-post about this blog'
---

As with most blogs (I assume), the first post on this blog will be about the blog itself.

The source code for this website is (at least for
now) [available on github](https://github.com/jewell-lgtm/mattjewell.de). But if you're taking a look, do be aware that
this is a repository designed to have exactly 1 contributor, so I've been very lax in terms of structuring commits. As I
am doing this all in my spare time I will be cutting corners here and there.

It's based on a template for [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) and uses
the [postcss plugin](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-plugin-postcss/) in order to
use [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) classes. Initially I wanted to use the JIT compilation feature of tailwind
as I've not had a chance to use it yet. I found that in JIT mode code completion
with [tailwindcss-classnames](https://github.com/muhammadsammy/tailwindcss-classnames) (a favourite package of mine) too
slow.

I chose [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) to host it as it has a generous free tier and works great with Gatsby. I've had a
lot of success using it in the past and find it to be perfect for my needs. I'm yet to see what happens when site hosted
on vercel gets a lot of traffic, but I'm excited to find out.

Other than that, there's not a huge amount to add at this stage, so hopefully by the time you are reading this there is
some real content to read through.
