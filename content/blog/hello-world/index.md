title: How I set up my blog date: "2021-06-12T14:45:03.284Z"
description: "An obligatory \"Hello, World\" meta-post about this blog"

As with most blogs (I assume), the first post on this blog will be about the blog itself.

The source code for this website is (at least for
now) [available on github](https://github.com/jewell-lgtm/mattjewell.de). But if you're taking a look, do be aware that
this is a repository designed to have exactly 1 contributor, so I've been very lax in terms of structuring commits. As I
am doing this all in my spare time I will be cutting corners here and there.

It's based on a template for [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) and uses
the [postcss plugin](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-plugin-postcss/) in order to
use [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) classes. Initially I wanted to use the JIT compilation feature of tailwind
as I've not had a chance to use it yet. I found that in JIT mode code completion
with [tailwindcss-classnames](https://github.com/muhammadsammy/tailwindcss-classnames) (a favourite package of mine) too
slow.

I chose [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) to host it as it has a generous free tier and works great with Gatsby. I've had a
lot of success using it in the past and find it to be perfect for my needs. I'm yet to see what happens when site hosted
on vercel gets a lot of traffic, but I'm excited to find out.

Other than that, there's not a huge amount to add at this stage, so hopefully by the time you are reading this there is
some real content to read through.
