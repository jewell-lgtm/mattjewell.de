## Subheader

I wrote this site for a number of reasons, and I have always done it in short spurts, usually when I should already be in bed.

Sometimes I am trying out a new tech, or business idea, or just trying to learn something new.

I always wish I had more time for this. But here we are. Warts, bugs, and all. CSS. etc.
